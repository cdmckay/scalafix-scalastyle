# scalafix-scalastyle

`scalafix-scalastyle` is a scalafix rule project which reimplements selected scalastyle checks as scalafix lint rules.

The project goal is a pragmatic replacement for scalastyle.

That means:

- a Scala 2 codebase should be able to move off scalastyle without losing the most useful checks
- the same rule set should still be usable when that codebase later moves to Scala 3
- rules already covered well by `scalafmt` or built-in scalafix should not be duplicated here
- compatibility is measured by behavior and migrated tests, not by preserving scalastyle's exact implementation or config format

In other words, this repo is trying to be a practical migration path, not a byte-for-byte clone of scalastyle.

Concretely, the approach is:

- reuse `scalafmt` where a formatting rule is already covered there
- reuse built-in scalafix rules where they already cover the intent
- implement the remaining scalastyle rules as custom `SyntacticRule`s
- port the upstream scalastyle test cases for each implemented rule

The current plan and rule categorization live in [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md).

Notes:

- `implemented` means the rule lives in this repo and has migrated tests.
- `planned` means the rule is still intended for this repo but has not been implemented yet.
- `IllegalImportsChecker` is currently partial: it supports `illegalImports`, but not upstream `exemptImports`.

## Installation

Once published, install the rules in your sbt build with:

```scala
ThisBuild / scalafixDependencies +=
  "st.process" %% "scalafix-scalastyle" % "VERSION"
```

Then enable whichever rules you want in `.scalafix.conf`.

For Scala 3 builds, use the Scala 2.13 artifact explicitly:

```scala
ThisBuild / scalafixDependencies +=
  ("st.process" %% "scalafix-scalastyle" % "VERSION")
    .cross(CrossVersion.for3Use2_13)
```

This matches the current Scalafix ecosystem pattern: the rules are published for Scala 2.12 and 2.13, and Scala 3 consumers use the 2.13 artifact.

## Implemented Rules

### ClassNamesChecker

Flags class names that do not match a configured regex.

```hocon
rules = [
  ClassNamesChecker
]

ClassNamesChecker.regex = "^[A-Z][A-Za-z]*$"
```

### CovariantEqualsChecker

```hocon
rules = [
  CovariantEqualsChecker

Important directories:

- `rules/`: custom scalafix rule implementations
- `tests/`: ScalaTest + scalafix testkit suites
- `input/` / `output/`: reserved for a more standard scalafix-testkit file-based layout; currently mostly unused
- `project/TargetAxis.scala`: helper for the sbt project-matrix test wiring

## Build And Test Model

This repo uses `sbt-projectmatrix` plus `sbt-scalafix`.

Rules:

- are compiled for Scala `2.12` and `2.13`
- are implemented as syntactic rules so they can run on both Scala 2 and Scala 3 source

Tests:

- run against Scala `2.12`
- run against Scala `2.13`
- run against Scala `3.3.7`

The test matrix is configured in [build.sbt](./build.sbt). The important point is that the rule implementation is cross-built for Scala 2, while the test inputs are exercised against both Scala 2 and Scala 3 dialects.

## Development Environment

This repo includes a Nix dev shell in [flake.nix](./flake.nix).

It provides:

- `jdk17_headless`
- `sbt`
- `coursier`

Enter the shell with:

```bash
nix develop
```

Then run normal sbt commands inside that shell.

## Common Commands

Run the full test suite:

```bash
sbt tests/test
```

Compile everything:

```bash
sbt compile
```

If you want the interactive sbt shell for repeated work:

```bash
sbt
```

## How To Add A Rule

The current workflow is:

1. Check whether the scalastyle rule is already covered by `scalafmt` or built-in scalafix.
2. Read the upstream scalastyle implementation and tests.
3. Add a rule implementation in `rules/src/main/scala/fix/<RuleName>.scala`.
4. Register it in `rules/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/scalafix.v1.Rule`.
5. Port the upstream tests into a dedicated suite file in `tests/src/test/scala/fix/<RuleName>Suite.scala`.
6. Run `sbt tests/test` until the ported cases pass across the matrix.

When a rule is intentionally implemented as a partial subset, that should be documented in this README and kept visible in the tests rather than implied away.

Current convention:

- one rule per source file
- one suite per rule
- tests are written with `AbstractSyntacticRuleSuite`

## Notes On Test Style

The current suites use inline `check(...)` calls instead of the more file-based `input/` / `output/` scalafix-testkit layout.

That is intentional for now:

- it keeps each rule self-contained while the project is still small
- it makes porting upstream scalastyle test cases straightforward
- it still exercises the rules through scalafix testkit

A later cleanup can migrate these suites to `input/` / `output/` fixtures if that becomes more useful.

## Compatibility Philosophy

This project is not trying to preserve scalastyle’s exact config format or exact internal implementation details.

It is trying to preserve:

- the intent of each rule
- the observable behavior covered by upstream tests
- usability on both Scala 2 and Scala 3 codebases

When a rule is already better handled by `scalafmt`, it should not be reimplemented here.

That tradeoff is deliberate: the repo prefers fewer rules with clearer ownership over reimplementing behavior that is already maintained elsewhere.
